# Relative Trans Influence of PbPh₃ and SnPh₃ Ligands in Pentacarbonylmanganese(I) Complexes

This repository hosts my undergraduate inorganic chemistry research report:

> **“Study on the Relative Trans Influence of –EPh₃ Ligands (E = Pb, Sn) in Pentacarbonylmanganese(I) Complexes like Mn(CO)₅PbPh₃ and Mn(CO)₅SnPh₃.”** :contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}  

All experimental work (synthesis, purification, spectroscopy, and crystallography) was carried out in the Advanced Inorganic Chemistry laboratory under Professor Timothy Johnstone's direction.

## 1. Project Overview

Trans influence describes how a ligand weakens the metal–ligand bond trans to it. Understanding this effect is important for tuning stability, reactivity, and selectivity in metal complexes and catalysts.

In this project, I investigated whether **–PbPh₃** and **–SnPh₃** ligands exert different trans influence when bound to Mn(I) in octahedral complexes:

- Mn(CO)₅PbPh₃  
- Mn(CO)₅SnPh₃  

The work combines **synthetic inorganic chemistry** with **IR spectroscopy** and **single-crystal X-ray diffraction** to compare Mn–C and C–O bond properties trans to the EPh₃ ligand. :contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}

## 2. Experimental Summary

Key steps and techniques: :contentReference[oaicite:2]{index=2}  

- **Synthesis**
  - Prepared **Ph₃PbCl** from **Ph₄Pb + HCl(g)** as an intermediate, using gas-generation and recrystallization.
  - Synthesized **Mn(CO)₅EPh₃ (E = Pb, Sn)** from **Mn₂(CO)₁₀**, Na/Hg amalgam, and **Ph₃ECl** (E = Pb, Sn).
- **Characterization**
  - Recorded **¹H, ¹¹⁹Sn, and ²⁰⁷Pb NMR** spectra to confirm ligand environments.
  - Collected **IR spectra (KBr pellets)** to measure CO stretching frequencies, especially the **trans CO band**.
  - Grew single crystals and collected **X-ray diffraction data**, then extracted **Mn–C** and **C–O** bond lengths for both cis and trans positions.

## 3. Key Findings

- The **trans CO stretching frequency** is **2092 cm⁻¹** for both Mn(CO)₅PbPh₃ and Mn(CO)₅SnPh₃, implying similar trans Mn–C bond strengths. :contentReference[oaicite:3]{index=3}  
- Statistical analysis of **Mn–C** and **C–O** bond lengths from X-ray data shows **no significant difference** between:
  - cis vs trans Mn–C bonds within each complex, or  
  - trans Mn–C bonds of the Pb complex vs the Sn complex. :contentReference[oaicite:4]{index=4}  
- Overall conclusion: within experimental uncertainty, **–PbPh₃ and –SnPh₃ exhibit no measurable difference in trans influence** in these Mn(I) carbonyl complexes. :contentReference[oaicite:5]{index=5}
